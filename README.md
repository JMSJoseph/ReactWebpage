# Trello-Like React App

The goal of this app is to get me used to React, including state managment, hooks, and references for Front-end development.
The second goal is to get more experience with Flask and my first experience with PostgreSQL for a backend.

## Current Features/Plans

- Develop a decent-looking front-end CSS (Done, can be improved)
- Modal for Posts (Done, can be improved)
- Add Posts and Columns (Done)
- Edit Posts and Columns (Done)
- Implement Backend using Flask and PostgresSQL (Implemented, needs some tightening)
- Dark mode (minor task, within a few days)
- Movable Posts (Should've done DND from start from a library, going to implement keyboard keys as a compromise)

## Tech Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Flask
- PostgreSQL
- Vite
